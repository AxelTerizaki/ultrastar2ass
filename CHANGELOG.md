# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.4

- Fix \k90 ASS tag not suitable for a 1000ms delay (my bad)
- Starting time for first line in a duet is now set correctly (thanks @Lpu8er)
- Added duet sample karaoke in test/
- Handled negative beat numbers

## 1.0.3

- Fix first comment being left out as a dialogue (the one with the ASS script)

## 1.0.2

- Dialogues are now copied as comments without the \fad ASS effect so you can properly edit it in Aegisub if you need to.

## 1.0.1

- Removed test file variable

## 1.0.0

- Initial version
